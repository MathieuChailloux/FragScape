about=NEW: raster mode</br></br>FragScape is a QGIS 3 plugin to compute landscape fragmentation metrics defined in paper "Landscape division, splitting index, and effective mesh size: new measures of landscape fragmentation" (Jaeger 2000). Among these metrics, effective mesh size has been widely used to quantify landscape fragmentation. FragScape defines a 4 steps process from raw data to computed metrics and allow user to save configuration so that results can be reproduced with same context. It has been developped by Mathieu Chailloux at INRAE, for the French ecological network resource center (driven by French ministry of ecology).
